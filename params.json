{"name":"reLove","tagline":"web-based client for reLive","body":"### About\r\nreLove is a project for talking with http://relive.nu/ and playing back shows listed there. It is mostly feature compatible with the two reLive desktop clients and also offers embedded options for single station or show views.\r\n\r\n### Installing\r\n**1a. From ZIP or TAR**\r\n\r\nJust use the links at the top of the page and unpack the archive into the desired directory.\r\n\r\n**1b. From Git**\r\n\r\nIf you already have Git or can get it, this is the easiest way to get this project and keep it updated.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd deployment_parent_directory\r\n$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/AMcBain/reLove.git\r\n```\r\n\r\n_If you're planning to deploy directly to a server this way, make sure your server is configured to block the .git directory and descendants (404 or 403, etc)._\r\n\r\n**2. Using**\r\n\r\nDesktop-local users can just double-click the index.html file in the deployment directory to run this project in a browser.\r\n\r\nIf deployed on a server, point your browser to where it was deployed. If that directory is not web accessible you will need to configure your web server. (Google is your friend.)\r\n\r\n**2a. Embedding**\r\n\r\nThis project supports embedding with iframes. This makes it easier to show a single station on a page or include a single show in a blog post. As with step two embedding requires this project be web accessible.
