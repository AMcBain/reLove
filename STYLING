This is a document to aid in restyling the IRC chat log markup. The defaults are
light and fit the project itself but the author of this project understands many
people prefer their chat views to look different.

Firstly, it is recommended to get a user styles add-on for your browser such as
Stylish, if you do not already have one:
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stylish/
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylish/fjnbnpbmkenffdnngjfgmeleoegfcffe
Such an add-on will make it easy to add your own user styles.

Secondly, to ensure the user styles only apply to the site where this project is
deployed, you should check out the Stylish wiki (
https://github.com/JasonBarnabe/stylish/wiki/Applying-styles-to-specific-sites )
for details on doing so as it differs by browser.

Finally, the following are selector hints for styles used by various parts of
the default chat log view and their purposes. If you don't wish to go through
all of that, you might try finding someone who did and ask them to share their
stylesheet with you.

.chatview {
    /* The container element. This is where the background color is. */
}

/*
   The following are all the event types. A table is used to display the log and
   for each line the first column is always the time, the second column is a
   nickname or '*', and the last the event contents. Each type section will
   indicate what is special about them, if anything. Each column is selected by
   way of '.chattypeMe:nth-child(2)' or '.chattypeMe:nth-child(3)'. Plan to start
   there if you want your selectors to win the specificity battle. Selectors can
   be shared if you intend several types to look similarly, they're just broken
   out below for ease of documentation.
   ex: .chattypeLeave td:nth-child(3), .chattypeQuit td:nth-child(3) { /* Styles. */ }
*/

.chattypeUnknown {
    /* Event with an unknown type. Haven't seen any logs with this event before.
       The default styles use a low-contrast color relative to the background
       for the entire row. */
}

.chattypeMessage {
    /* Standard message. (<Nickname> blah blah) */
}


.chattypeMe {
    /* Action message. The first column contains a '*' instead of a nickname.
      The nickname in the third column is wrapped in a span.
      (* Nickname waves their hand) */
}

.chattypeJoin {
    /* Join event. The first column contains a '*' instead of a nickname.
       (* Nickname joins #channel) */
}

.chattypeLeave {
    /* Leave event. The first column contains a '*' instead of a nickname.
       May include the reason for leaving. (* Nickname has left #channel) */
}

.chattypeQuit {
    /* Quit event. The first column contains a '*' instead of a nickname.
       May include the reason for quitting. (* Nickname has quit (blah)) */
}

.chattypeNick {
    /* Nickname rename event. The first column contains a '*' instead of a
       nickname. (* Nickname is now known as Newname) */
}

.chattypeTopic {
    /* Topic change event. The first column contains a '*' instead of a
       nickname. (* Nickname has set the topic to: blah blah) */
}

.chattypeMode {
    /* User or channel mode change event. The first column contains a '*'
       instead of a nickname. (* Nickname has set mode +v on Othername) */
}

.chattypeKick {
    /* Kick event. The first column contains a '*' instead of a nickname.
       May include the reason for the kick.
       (* Nickname has kicked Othername from #channel (blah blah)) */
}
